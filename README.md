### Colors
- Since this game is basically simple, I wanted to add to the dynamism of the site with various colors for fonts/backgrounds and sharper transitions between sections.
- As a result, you may see different shades of pink/purple, yellow, black and red.
- However, I made sure that everything was readable.
- Colour contrast was first verified on [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/).

### Fonts
- I used a lot of different colors for the background and the letters, so I decided on just one font: Roboto from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto).
- This font is quite clear, legible, simple but still looks cool.

### Icons
- Icons, or rather emojis, used on the site are taken from [Get Emoji](https://getemoji.com/).
- They seemed very interesting, even though they are displayed differently on different devices/applications, which can be annoying, but again, I think all of their variants look nice.  
![Emoji Example](assets/img/readme/emoji.webp)
- I also used the rock, paper, scissors emojis to create a favicon with the help of [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) and [Favicon Generator](https://www.favicon-generator.org/).

## Styling, Formating and Features


### Head Section


### Header Section


### Game Section


### Footer Section


### HTTP 404 Page
- As a small addition I designed and developed an 404 HTTP error page.
- I kept the header and footer of the main page, without Rules of the game in footer section.
- I didn't want to be it too complicated, because there should be a simple message on this page. Using the same color palette and fonts I added an error message card and an additional link to the main page.
